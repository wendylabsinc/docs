# Integration Testing

This document describes the CI integration test pipeline for WendyOS and wendy-agent.

## Overview

Integration tests run against real hardware devices discovered on the CI LAN. The pipeline has three jobs:

| Job | Runner | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `discover` | ubuntu-latest | Discovers LAN devices via `wendy discover` |
| `integration-test-macos` | macos | Builds `wendy` and runs the full test suite on discovered devices |
| `integration-test-linux` | ubuntu-latest | Builds `wendy` and runs the Linux-compatible subset of the test suite |

> **Note:** The `summary` job was removed. Pass/fail status is determined directly from the `integration-test-macos` and `integration-test-linux` job results.

## Test cases

The following named test cases are registered in the pipeline:

| Test | macOS | Linux | Description |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| `swift-hello` | ✅ | ❌ | Basic Swift app smoke test |
| `swift-network` | ✅ | ❌ | Swift app with network entitlement |
| `swift-bluetooth` | ✅ | ❌ | Swift app with Bluetooth entitlement |
| `swift-resources` | ✅ | ❌ | Swift app verifying SwiftPM resource bundle syncing |
| `python-hello` | ✅ | ✅ | Basic Python app smoke test |
| `python-network` | ✅ | ✅ | Python app with network entitlement |
| `python-gpu` | ✅ | ✅ | Python app with GPU entitlement |
| `python-bluetooth` | ✅ | ✅ | Python app with Bluetooth entitlement |
| `python-no-network` | ✅ | ✅ | Python app with networking disabled |
| `python-no-bluetooth` | ✅ | ✅ | Python app with Bluetooth disabled |
| `python-no-ptrace` | ✅ | ✅ | Verifies `ptrace` syscall is blocked by the default seccomp profile (WDY-1099) |
| `python-no-unshare` | ✅ | ✅ | Verifies `unshare` syscall is blocked by the default seccomp profile (WDY-1099) |
| `python-multiservice` | ✅ | ✅ | Multi-service `wendy.json`: parallel build, dependency-ordered creation, and `--service` filtering |
| `otel-localhost-only` | ✅ | ✅ | Verifies OTEL receivers bind to 127.0.0.1 only (WDY-1097, WDY-1100) |

Swift tests are excluded from the default Linux suite because Swift container builds require macOS. They can still be run manually on Linux by specifying them via the `INPUT_TESTS` workflow input — the Linux runner skips any `swift-*` test when it appears in `INPUT_TESTS`.

## Device discovery

The `discover` job runs `wendy discover --json --timeout 10s` to find devices on the LAN. Discovery failures are non-fatal (`|| true`); if no devices are found the test jobs exit cleanly with a success status.

## Running tests

### Default (all registered tests)

Trigger the workflow without inputs. The macOS job runs all tests; the Linux job runs all tests except `swift-*`.

### Selective runs (`INPUT_TESTS`)

Provide a comma-separated list of test names via the `INPUT_TESTS` workflow input:

```
python-hello, otel-localhost-only
```

Each name is trimmed of whitespace. If all provided test names resolve to an empty set (e.g. no devices were found), the job exits successfully without running anything.

## Test script

Tests are executed via `scripts/test-ci.sh`. The script is invoked once per discovered device:

```sh
scripts/test-ci.sh $TEST_ARGS -h "$device"
```

where `TEST_ARGS` contains one `-t <name>` flag per test case and `-w <absolute-path-to-wendy-binary>`.

The wendy binary path is resolved to an absolute path at the start of the job to avoid working-directory-relative path issues.

## `python-no-ptrace` and `python-no-unshare` tests

Added in wendy-agent#603 to provide regression coverage for [WDY-1099](https://github.com/wendylabsinc/wendy-agent/pull/600). These are **negative tests** — they assert that certain dangerous syscalls are denied inside Wendy app containers by the default seccomp profile.

`python-no-ptrace` calls `ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 0, 0)` via `ctypes` and expects `EPERM`/`EACCES`. A successful call would indicate the seccomp profile was not applied.

`python-no-unshare` calls `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` via `ctypes` and expects failure. `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` is the first step in a common unprivileged container-escape chain; denial confirms the seccomp profile blocks the `unshare` syscall entirely.

Both tests exit `0` on a correct denial and `1` if the syscall unexpectedly succeeds.

See [OCI Entitlements — Seccomp profile](../../wendy-agent/oci/entitlements.md#seccomp-profile) for the full profile spec.

## `python-multiservice` test

Provides integration coverage for parallel multi-service build in `wendy run` (WDY-892). The test fixture is a two-service `wendy.json` project with a `db` service and an `api` service that declares `"dependsOn": ["db"]`.

The test runs three sub-cases:

1. **Full deploy** — all services are built and created via `wendy run --deploy`.
2. **`--service` filtering** — only `api` (and its dependency `db`) are built and created via `wendy run --deploy --service api`.
3. **Unknown service error** — `wendy run --deploy --service ghost` must exit non-zero and include the unknown name in its error output.

## `otel-localhost-only` test

Added in PR #598 to provide regression coverage for [WDY-1097 and WDY-1100](https://github.com/wendylabsinc/wendy-agent/pull/597). This test verifies that the OpenTelemetry (OTEL) receivers inside wendy-agent bind exclusively to `127.0.0.1` and are not reachable on external interfaces. It runs on both macOS and Linux CI runners.

See [wendy-agent/otel.md](../../wendy-agent/otel.md) for documentation on the OTEL integration.
